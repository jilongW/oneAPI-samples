# `Intel Python daal4py Getting Started` Sample

This Getting Started sample code show how to do batch linear regression using the python API package daal4py from oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL). It demonstrates how to use software products that can be found in the [oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL)](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/onedal.html) or the [AI Tools](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/artificial-intelligence/frameworks-tools.html).

## Purpose

daal4py is a simplified API to the Intel® Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel® DAAL) that allows for fast usage of the framework suited for Data Scientists or Machine Learning users. Built to help provide an abstraction to Intel® DAAL for direct usage or integration into your framework.

In this sample, you will run a batch Linear Regression model with oneDAL daal4py library memory objects. You will also learn how to train a model and save the information to a file.

## Key Implementation Details
This Getting Started sample code is implemented for CPU using the Python language. The example assumes you have daal4py and scikit-learn installed inside a conda environment, similar to what is delivered with the installation of the Intel&reg; Distribution for Python* as part of the [AI Tools](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/artificial-intelligence/frameworks-tools.html).

## Using Visual Studio Code* (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel Software Developer Tools**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel Software Developer Tools**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel® oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

## Building daal4py for CPU

oneAPI Data Analytics Library is ready for use once you finish the AI Tools installation and have run the post installation script.

You can refer to the oneAPI [main page](https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi) for toolkit installation and the Toolkit [Getting Started Guide for Linux](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-intel-oneapi-linux-get-started-with-the-intel-ai-analytics-toolkit) for post-installation steps and scripts.

### Activate conda environment With Root Access

Please follow the Getting Started Guide steps (above) to set up your oneAPI environment with the `setvars.sh` script. Then navigate in Linux shell to your oneapi installation path, typically `/opt/intel/oneapi/` when installed as root or sudo, and `~/intel/oneapi/` when not installed as a superuser. If you customized the installation folder, the `setvars.sh` file is in your custom folder.

Intel Python environment will be active by default. However, if you activated another environment, you can return with the following command:

#### On a Linux* System
```
source activate base
```

### Activate conda environment Without Root Access (Optional)

By default, the AI Tools is installed in the ‘inteloneapi’ folder, which requires root privileges to manage it. If you would like to bypass using root access to manage your conda environment, then you can clone your desired conda environment using the following command:

#### On a Linux* System
```
conda create --name usr_intelpython --clone base
```

Then activate your conda environment with the following command:

```
source activate usr_intelpython
```

### Install Jupyter Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook in the directory housing the code example

```
conda install jupyter nb_conda_kernels
```

#### View in Jupyter Notebook

_Note: This distributed execution cannot be launched from the jupyter notebook version, but you can still view inside the notebook to follow the included write-up and description._

Launch Jupyter Notebook in the directory housing the code example

```
jupyter notebook
```
